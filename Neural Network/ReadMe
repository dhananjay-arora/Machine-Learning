Neural Network


II.A 5-fold Cross Validation
- Explain and use 5-fold cross validation to find a good neural network parameters including the structure to report the CV accuracies.
III.B Nonlinear Regression
- Summarize the nonlinear regression model.
- Use the NeuralNet class for regression to apply to your data.
- Explain your codes (not in comment).
III.C Nonlinear Logistic Regression

- Check if your codes works well with toy synthetic data.
- Apply to your classification data.
- Explain your codes.
IV - Results
- Presents the results of comparison of the tested models with CV errors.
- Visualize the results
- What do you think about the results?
